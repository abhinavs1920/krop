# Overview

Krop is a full-stack web framework. This means it includes features for building user interfaces, which can be driven by a server or run entirely on the client. It also adept at handling applications that serve APIs from a server, or run entirely on a client.

Right now Krop is in a very early stage of development, so you might find some pieces are currently missing. We're working on that, as this is an open source project you're welcome to join in.
