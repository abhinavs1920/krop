# Krop

Krop is an experiment in making http4s easy to use. Hopefully these ideas will find their way back into http4s in due course. If not, this library will provide an easy-to-use alternative to the complexity of http4s, while retaining is good features.

## Getting Started

To use Krop, add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.creativescala" %% "krop" % "@VERSION@"
```

## ScalaDoc

See the ScalaDoc @:api(krop.index) for API documentation.
